# Koch_Snowflake

# Starting
I'd need variables to control the length of the recursive triangles, and another variable for the number of iterations of recursions. Like we saw in the recursive circles, if there are too many recursive circles, the code lags out.

# Setup
Use a noLoop() to prevent the function from being run repeatedly.

# Draw Function
I'd have a translate function move the coordinates of the canvas to the middle.
